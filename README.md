### Setup environment:
- open the console
- which python --> prints the current environment
- source HPC4WC_venv/bin/activate --> loads the correct environment
- check again with which python, if it worked

### Run stencil_main.py
- move to its folder
- run with:
python3 stencil_main.py --dim_stencil 3 --nx 10 --ny 10 --nz 10 --num_iter 100 --stencil_name test

For help about available options type: 
python3 stencil_main.py --help



### Validation and performance report options
- Set the option create_field = True (Default) to create a new random field that is saved as a .npy file.
- Set then the option create_field to False to validate the out fields of different stencils to the original numpy field.
- With each new field automatically a new csv-report is generated, where the properties of the run and the elapsed work time is summed up as a table.
- Further validation runs are added as a row to the already generated performance report.
- If the field shapes of the original and the control file are not equal, the program stops. To generate however a report with stencils of different field sizes and no validation set the option create_newreport to False. 

Example for validation:
python3 stencil_main.py --nx 10 --ny 10 --nz 10 --num_iter 100 --stencil_name laplacian_numbaloop --create_field False



### Next To Do's:
* implement laplap


### Fragezeichen
*Clarify in which direction are we calculating the 1D, 2D, 3D laplacian (which dim is the first dim): similar to laplacian code we would take Z dim as first dim?
*Do we need the backup if the halos have the size 1 that the last value is not used for calculation? (yes for laplap?)
then: how to implement this in numba?
